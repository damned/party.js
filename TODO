 party events requirements

 0  [vTICK] must: clearer than just function replacement
 1  [vTICK] must: just a function call
 2  [vTICK] must: be easy to use in tests - add a 'raised' counter on event
 3          should: give good error messages on misuse - downgraded from must cos i don't know how should be used :7/
 4  [vTICK] should: use function not string name of function
 5          should: have a way of making obvious if event not listened to - maybe just call trace() to turn it on?
 6  [vTICK] should: set 'this' to be the receiving object (so event independent of source), change to api
                  (to explicitly pass receiving obj so 'party' knows who to set 'this' to)
 7          nice: specifies contract (i.e. what arguments passed)
 8  [vTICK] nice: multiple listeners
 9          nice: guard who (which obj) can raise events?
 10 [vTICK] nice: make raise object optional - just call directly on events
 11 [vTICK] nice: include events object directly in api of host (remove 'raised_from')?
 12 [vTICK] nice: allow a pure-function listener (not on an object)
 13 [vTICK] nice: allow briefer event function declaration: name: event([arg[s]])?
 14         idea: allow async raising of event?
 15 [vTICK] nice: resurrect 'raised_from' as 'from' so can raise event calling directly: sender.the_event()
 16         nice: descriptive toString of events on events object
 17         should: allow 'unwire_from' and 'unwire'
