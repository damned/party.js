 party events requirements

 0  [vTICK] must: clearer than just function replacement
 1  [vTICK] must: just a function call
 2          must: be easy to use in tests
 3          must: give good error messages on misuse
 4  [vTICK] should: use function not string name of function
 5          should: warn if event not listened to
 6  [vTICK] should: set 'this' to be the receiving object (so event independent of source), change to api
                  (to explicitly pass receiving obj so 'party' knows who to set 'this' to)
 7          nice: specifies contract (i.e. what arguments passed)
 8          nice: multiple listeners
 9          nice: guard who (which obj) can raise events?
 10         nice: remove raise object - just call directly on events
 11         nice: include events object directly in api of host (remove 'raised_from')?
 12         nice: allow a pure-function listener (not on an object)
 13         nice: allow briefer event function declaration: name: event([arg[s]])?
